  - Rotation Joint has been split into 2 classes

For PR2,
  - Continuous collision checking with no penetration allowed.
    - Validate interval for each collision pair at the beginning of the path,
    - iteratively
      - sort collision pair by increasing upper bound of valid interval,
      - take middle of first non validated interval as new parameter,
      - validate new parameter for first pair,
      - compute partial forward kinematics.
  - no path optimization,
  - directed roadmaps.
  - The same as 2014-09-12 with recent versions of the packages.

For HRP2,
  - Continuous collision checking (progressive) with penetration 0.025.
  - The same as 2014-09-18 with recent version of the packages.
