  - Continuous collision checking with penetration 0.025,
    - evaluate collision between pairs at increasing sequence of parameters
      along path (if not reverse).
      Next parameter is computed in such a way that no point has moved by more
      than twice the penetration. If collision extract path between start and
      last validated configuration.
  - no path optimization,
  - directed roadmaps,
