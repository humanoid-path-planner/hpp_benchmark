For PR2,
  - Continuous collision checking with no penetration allowed.
    - Validate interval for each collision pair at the beginning of the path,
    - iteratively
      - sort collision pair by increasing upper bound of valid interval,
      - take middle of first non validated interval as new parameter,
      - validate new parameter for first pair,
      - compute partial forward kinematics.
  - no path optimization,
  - directed roadmaps.

For HRP2,
  - Continuous collision checking (progressive) with penetration 0.025.

Freeflyer and planar joint are now composed of 2 and 3 dimensional translation
joints.
