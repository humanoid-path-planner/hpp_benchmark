New set of benchmark with

  - coal library (devel branch after v3.0.0) replacing hpp-fcl,
  - pinocchio  (devel branch after v3.3.0).

Latest version of pinocchio required to fix setup.py scripts in construction-set.
Note: launching romeo-placard-spf benchmark resulted in a crash of HPP in
  command ps.clearRoadmap(). The results reported here have been obtained by
  launching HPP a second time. To be investigated.
