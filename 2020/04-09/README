This set of benchmark has been run with a version of HPP that contains the
following modifications:
  - computation of right hand side of explicit constraints has been modified.
  - construction of the constraint graph in python
    1. inserts LevelSetEdge instances where necessary,
    2. inserts grasp/complement constraints between pregrasp and grasp,
    3. inserts placement/complement constraints between preplacement and
       placement.

Notes
-----
  1. modification 3. requires to set factory.constraints.strict to
True in the scripts. This flag forces the factory not to use locked joints
as complement of placement constraints.
  2. numerical error threshold has been set to 1e-4 in benchmark romeo-placard.

Warning: benchmark pr2-manipulation-kitchen returns wrong paths were the object
jumps from one contact surface to the other one.
