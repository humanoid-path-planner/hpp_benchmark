Compared with 2020-04-09, there is one modification in hpp-manipulation-corba:
In the construction of the constraint graph in python
  1. grasp/complement constraints between pregrasp and grasp,
  2. placement/complement constraints between preplacement and placement
are not anymore inserted.

Note that romeo-placard and ur3-spheres fail.
